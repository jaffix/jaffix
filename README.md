Hello There! 

   Iâ€™m @jaffix a aboslute dork who likes to try and make things occasionally.
   I'm **super** interested in computer networking, game developmenmt and web development front and back-end.
   Sometimes I get bored and start a project to learn or make something within said interested areas in which I might post here as a portfolio.
